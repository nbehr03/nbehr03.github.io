    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>My name is Noelle Behr.</p>
    <p>I am a sophomore at CU Boulder, and I major in Creative Technology and Design.
        I am originally from Colorado Springs.
        In my free time,
        I play women's rugby on the club team at CU Boulder, and
        I spend a lot of time at St. Thomas Aquinas Church in Boulder.
    </p>
    <p>My goals for this course are to expand my knowledge in coding,
        and learn how to make a website that I can add to my portfolio.
